# Blog API

Blog API is an application for both reading and writing articles or stories. Authenticated users can create an article through writing a title, description, and body content. Published articles will show up on the blog page for other users to read and comment on. Non-published articles will be save for the author to read or edit.

This is a project under the Odin Project curriculum. The purpose is to build a blog API with two front end applications. One is for authors to write, edit and publish their posts. The other one is for viewers to read and comment on published posts.

## Features

- A simple API to interact with blog's data.
- CRUD operations for posts, comments, and users/authors.
- Authentication, Authorization and protected routes to prevent access to data from non-authorized users.

## Built with

React, Express, NodeJS, Prisma ORM, Passport-Local, Passport-JWT

## Lessons Learned

This project is still in development.

Some things I've learned while working on this project. I've got to think about how the frontend is going to be set up in the beginning to set up the backend routes. I recently was building out the frontend blog page, and realized that a request I was trying to make wasn't giving me back what I was expecting. Yet, when I was setting up the backend routes it made sense to return those values.

Another big thing, when I was originally designing the project it was simple and following the requirements given to me by the odin project. Later in the project, I would have to rethink how I wanted interactions and visuals to be represented. Often I would look around for inspiration on other blog sites to find how I wanted mine to work. I would get distracted by features that they had that mine did not. Such as a letting a user save posts for a later reading, or a following/followers interaction on account pages. Then I would be think of how to implement those features and more, getting overwhelmed I would have to write it down and refocus on what I was working on originally. I fould that using Notion to help me track my tasks by what I need to do, what I am working on, and what was done has helped tremendously. I made a separate table for extra features I could add later down the line, but were not required of me to finish the project. The excitement to build this project out more is still here just in a more organized and thought out way now.
